		<p>There are a few things I like about this website. I like that there are a lot of links and a tags, and that there are a lot of separate div elements that each contain id and style attributes to the give the site's images shape and the div tags help for CSS i think. There are script elements being used that link to some javascript I think. Hopefully I can incorporate some more of these things on my site in the future!  </p>
